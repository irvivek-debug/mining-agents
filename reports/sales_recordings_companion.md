# Agent Recordings — Sales Companion

One entry per agent. Each recording opens on the operational question,
shows the agent reading BigQuery live (the tool trace), then scrolls
the answer at reading pace. Note for live demos: agents answer in
seconds via the API but typically 2–4 minutes through the chat UI —
the on-screen tool trace is the proof of grounding; narrate over it.
