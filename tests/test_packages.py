"""Gate: the generated per-agent packages are deployable and stay a thin shim.

The ADK deploy verb takes a DIRECTORY, not an agent id, so each of the 52
entrypoints needs its own package. The risk this file guards against is that
the generated tree becomes a second source of truth: if agent logic were copied
into it, the copy would drift from the catalog and nothing would notice.
