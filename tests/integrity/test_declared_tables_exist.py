"""Gates on the claims the agent catalogue makes about the world.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
The repo already enforces honesty on its own SQL: assert_reads_only_declared_
tables checks that every method-pack query reads only what it declared, and all
40 SQL files pass it. Nothing applied the same standard to the VAULT catalogue,
which is imported as trusted data but is really a set of assertions -- and
assertions need tests.

Unguarded, it drifted badly. 26 of 34 declared tables did not exist, 65 of 101
agents had zero surviving grounding, and the front end published "Data
provenance" for tables nobody could query. None of that failed a test, a build
or a deploy. It surfaced only when agents were driven through the UI and the
careful ones said they could not evidence their answers.

These are integration tests: they ask BigQuery and Vertex rather than guessing.
