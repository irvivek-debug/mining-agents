"""The retry-once block runs unattended, and only on the failure path.

Every live run so far has passed, so this branch has never executed. It is
tested here against the harness's own source text -- not a paraphrase --
so a drift in the script is a test failure rather than a silent no-op at
3am.

Why it exists: a single FAIL cannot distinguish a broken agent from a bad
minute. S01-1-LITHOLOGY stalled after 1 tool call in 67s, then passed the
identical probe minutes later with 7 calls in 24s. S08-R-CRITIC did the
same. Both were recorded as failures by a harness that never asked twice.
