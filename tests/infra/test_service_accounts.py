"""Tests for the three-account tier model.

Ruled 2026-08-12: every agent runs as one of three shared service accounts
rather than one account each. The reasoning is in the module docstring of
infra/iam/service_accounts.py. These tests pin both the model and the two
things it costs, so neither can become invisible:

  - the coordinator account over-grants dataEditor to S03, S06, and S12
  - biometric access is no longer restricted at the IAM layer at all
