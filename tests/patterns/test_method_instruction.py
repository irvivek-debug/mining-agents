"""Tests for the METHOD instruction block and the tool bindings that support it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
Before this task, build_instruction was a retrieval-governance layer: scope,
citation, tool failure, never-invent. The METHOD block is the change the whole
redesign turns on. Without it, the agent is a natural-language-to-SQL service.
With it, the agent is told to work a driver tree and return a diagnosis.

Every test here guards a clause that would silently disappear under a refactor
unless something names it explicitly.
