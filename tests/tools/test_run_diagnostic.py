"""Tests for run_diagnostic — the tool that executes a driver's fixed query.

`method_lookup` hands the agent its driver tree but withholds each driver's
SQL, on the reasoning that a model handed a query will paraphrase or mutate the
diagnostic.  `run_diagnostic` closes the loop: the agent names a driver, the
runtime resolves the SQL, runs it, and returns the result.  The diagnostic that
ships is the diagnostic that runs.

The guard travels with every result, because a result that arrives without its
guard invites an unguarded recommendation.  The SQL text and the file path do
not — returning them would undo the withholding that `method_lookup` enforces.
