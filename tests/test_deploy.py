"""Gate: what the deploy sends is what the agents actually need at runtime.

The expensive failure this file guards against is a deploy that succeeds, a
container that builds, and an agent that then dies on its first query because a
file it reads at runtime never travelled. That round trip costs a full container
build to discover and the error surfaces nowhere near its cause. It has happened
once: `references/` was omitted and every agent crashed on `model-policy.md`.

Cloud Run makes that failure mode sharper, not milder. The `cloud_run` verb has
no `--extra_packages` — it copies the agent directory and nothing else — so the
question "did everything travel?" is now answered entirely by what
`scripts.packages` writes. `test_a_generated_package_imports_with_only_the_agents_root_on_sys_path`
is the test that actually answers it, by reproducing the container's import
environment rather than asserting about paths.
