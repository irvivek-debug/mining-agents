/* A document small enough to reason about, for running a screen's own scripts.
 *
 * These screens are classic <script src> tags with no build step, so the only
 * honest way to find out what one of them puts on the page is to run it. This
 * is not a browser and does not pretend to be: it resolves ids, keeps text, and
 * forgets the ids belonging to a node whose innerHTML was replaced — which is
 * exactly the fault that would occur if two mounts shared one element.
 *
 * It lives in its own file because two callers need it. tests/js/handover.test.js
 * runs the workspace pages against a fake EventSource to watch the stream
 * lifecycle, and tests/js/screen-render.js runs any screen once and prints what
 * it drew, which is what tests/test_screen_copy.py counts disclosures in.

/** Every tag carrying an id, with the class it was written with.
 *
 *  The class comes along because on the workspace pages it is load-bearing: the
 *  block that says whether the agents are reachable is read as much from its
 *  frame as from its badge, and a harness that dropped the class on the floor
 *  would let a ✓ READY render inside the amber absence box and call it passing.
