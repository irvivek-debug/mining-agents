/* The handover sheet, loaded the way a browser loads it.
 *
 * Two claims are worth pinning here and neither can be pinned from source text.
 * The first is that no block on the page states anything about the connection
 * before /api/runtime has answered — the bug this replaces printed NOT
 * CONNECTED from a constant baked into bundle.js, and read as a working system
 * reporting itself broken. The second is the stream lifecycle behind the Run
 * button: EventSource reconnects by itself whenever a connection closes, so an
 * abandoned stream re-asks a question measured at a little under two minutes of
 * real model time, over and over, and bills for every repeat.
 *
 * So the page scripts are run in a vm against a document small enough to reason
 * about. It is not a browser and does not pretend to be: it resolves ids, keeps
 * text, and forgets the ids belonging to a node whose innerHTML was replaced —
 * which is exactly the fault that would occur if the run control and the sheet
 * were mounted on the same element.
 *
 * The cockpit rides along in one test because it is the other page that says
 * something about the connection in two places at once.
