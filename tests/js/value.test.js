/* apps/workspace/value.html -- rendered the way a browser runs it, via

 * The page was rebuilt from three prose bands into four visual ones for a
 * sales/consulting audience (design brief, 2026-08-18). These tests check the
 * things that brief made binding: no currency figure anywhere, every
 * benchmark percentage carries a named attribution and is visually marked as
 * an industry range rather than a site measurement, the addressable-pool
 * treatment survives unchanged, the hinge line and the six levers are exactly
 * what the brief specified, and the page still ends in exactly one
 * collapsible.
