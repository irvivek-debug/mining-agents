/* The swarm authorship rules.
 *
 * A Pattern A swarm streams five authors over one connection: three
 * specialists, a critic, then the coordinator. Measured on S07 against the
 * governing P6 question, they wrote 4,898 / 7,195 / 5,982 / 3,421 characters
 * of prose before the coordinator wrote a word. Rendered without regard to
 * author, all of it lands in the answer pane as one document, in finish order
 * — so the reader meets two specialists improvising off tables the critic then
 * rejects as out of scope, and meets them BEFORE the answer.
 *
 * The swarm's own design says which one is the answer: the coordinator
 * concludes last, after the critic has audited the rest. Everything before it
 * is working material.
