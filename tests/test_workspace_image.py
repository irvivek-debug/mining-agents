"""Gate: the workspace container's dependency list stays honest.

`apps/workspace/requirements.txt` is deliberately not the repository's. The
root list installs google-adk and google-cloud-aiplatform because that is what
an AGENT needs; this container runs no agent, and installing them here would
add roughly a gigabyte to the image for code paths the process never reaches.

That claim is only safe while it stays true. `server.py` imports
`mining_agents.registry` and `scripts.deploy` — modules shared with code that
does build agents — so a single module-level `from google.adk...` added
anywhere in that graph would silently reintroduce the dependency, and the
symptom would be a container that fails to start long after the commit that
caused it. This file catches it at test time instead.
