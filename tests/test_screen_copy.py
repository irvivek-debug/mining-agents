"""Gate: every screen speaks plainly, and hides its machinery at the end.

The instruction was explicit — a functional reader gets plain language and
tables, and technical detail goes at the end behind a collapsible. Both halves
are checkable: the jargon is a fixed list, and the drawer is a fixed component.

The check is on the *visible* text of each screen — what the markup shows and
what the JS puts on the page — and it deliberately excludes two things.

The first is the technical drawer, which is where the jargon is supposed to be.
That means the ``technicalDrawer(...)`` call and the ``drawerBody()`` function
each screen writes to fill it. Excluding only the call, as an earlier draft of
this file did, was wrong in a way that mattered: every screen composes its
drawer as ``technicalDrawer(drawerBody(), hint)``, so the jargon the drawer is
built to hold lives in that function and nowhere near the call.

The second is everything that never reaches a reader — comments, and, in JS,
identifiers. ``row.p90``, ``g.traversal`` and ``catalog.by_apqc_code`` are field
names in window.MINING_DATA. A screen cannot rename them and a reader never
sees them, so the JS half of a screen is scanned through its string literals,
with ``${...}`` interpolations removed. HTML is scanned whole, because an id or
a class name there is cheap to keep plain and a title or a placeholder attribute
is read out loud by a screen reader.

Absence is only half a gate. A screen can satisfy "no jargon" by deleting the
fact, or by inventing a private synonym for it, and both are worse than the
jargon. So two further checks run alongside: the plain phrases must be the ones
apps/shared/plain.js publishes, and the drawer must still name what the body
gave up.
