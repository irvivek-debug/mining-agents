"""Open a Playwright-owned browser and wait for a human to sign in.

WHY A SEPARATE PROFILE
Video recording requires Playwright to own the browser context -- record_video_dir
is set at context creation and cannot be attached to a browser someone else
launched. So the MCP browser that was signed into by hand cannot be recorded,
and this script brings up its own Chromium with a persistent profile instead.

The profile is what makes one sign-in enough: the session lives in
data/uat/.profile and is reused by every later run, including after a restart.
No credential is read, stored or transmitted by this script -- the human types
into a real Google page and Chromium keeps the cookie exactly as it would
normally.
