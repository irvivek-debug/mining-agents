"""Deploy the 52 entrypoints to Cloud Run and attach their runtime identity.

Ruling 1: the ADK 2.6.3 deploy verb takes an agent DIRECTORY, not an agent id:
  python -m google.adk.cli deploy cloud_run \\
    --project=<PROJECT> --region=<REGION> --service_name=<NAME> <AGENT_DIRECTORY>

Ruling 3: DOMAIN_BINDING_COMMAND is NEVER executed by this module. It is
printed with a warning and the caller is required to run it manually if approved.

WHY CLOUD RUN AND NOT AGENT ENGINE — ruled 2026-08-12
------------------------------------------------------
Agent Engine bills memory continuously whether or not anyone calls the agent.
Measured via Cloud Monitoring on this project: `reasoning_engine/cpu/
allocation_time` scales to zero, but `reasoning_engine/memory/allocation_time`
holds a flat 14,400 GiB-seconds per hour — exactly 4 GiB — across six-hour
windows with zero requests. At the catalogued rate of $0.009/GiB-hour that is
$26.28 per agent per month, idle, forever; $1,366/month for all 52. ADK exposes
no memory or CPU knob for the `agent_engine` verb, so the 4 GiB is not
negotiable.

Cloud Run scales to zero: idle cost is $0, and a 30-second query on 1 vCPU /
2 GiB costs about $0.0009. The standing cost becomes the container images in
Artifact Registry, roughly $6/month for 52.

Two things got simpler in the move, both of which had been real defects:

  * Identity is attached AT DEPLOY, via `--service-account`. The Agent Engine
    path had no such flag and needed a follow-up PATCH, which left a window
    where the agent ran as the shared Vertex service agent — holding none of
    the per-tier limits the access model is built on.
  * Instances are keyed by a real NAME. The Agent Engine path had to key on
    displayName, the only field this repo controlled, so renaming a deployed
    agent silently created a second billing instance. `gcloud run deploy
    <service>` is create-or-update on the name, so re-running is idempotent by
    construction and no read-back of live state is needed.

The dry run prints the exact argv the real run executes, because both come from
`deploy_command`. A dry run that renders a command by hand is worse than no dry
run at all: it reads as evidence while being free to drift from what actually
happens. This module had that defect once already.
