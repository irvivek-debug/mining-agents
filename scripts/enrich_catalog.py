"""Populate the data catalog for the BQ Data Agent showcase tables.

The Conversational Analytics engine retrieves table and column descriptions
through BigQuery's metadata layer (Dataplex Universal Catalog). Before this
script, 0 of 10 showcase tables had a description and 11 of 581 columns did:
the agent was working from column names alone. Descriptions written here are
business language — the mining jargon a presenter will actually use (CSS,
TML, laycan, demurrage) — so natural-language prompts land without naming
columns.

Idempotent: re-running overwrites the same descriptions.
