"""Generate apps/frontend/data.js from the agent catalogue.

WHY GENERATED, NOT PASTED
The five-screen front end was handed over as two HTML files whose agent data
had been injected at runtime by the deployed frontend service. Snapshotting
that injected blob would freeze a copy that drifts from the registry the moment
anyone edits an agent. `catalog_definitions.CATALOG` is the registry's own
source of truth -- 101 AgentCards -- so the screens are built from it directly.

The catalogue and manifest are read from `vendor/agent_registry/`, which holds
verbatim copies of the vault originals. See that directory's README for why
they are vendored and how to refresh them.

The persona and node datasets have no such upstream: they are presentation
content that ships with the design. They live in data-static.js and are edited
by hand, which is stated here so nobody looks for a generator that isn't there.

WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS AUTHORED
Every per-agent field below is read from the catalogue or the manifest. Two
lookup tables are editorial and marked as such: DEPARTMENT_STAKE (why a board
cares about a department) and the plain-English glosses on value class,
authority and fallback. They are exhaustive over the catalogue's closed enums
-- there is no default branch -- so a new enum value fails here loudly instead
of rendering an empty card on a sales screen.
