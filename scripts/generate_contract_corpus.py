"""Generate the vendor-contract document corpus from the contracts already in BigQuery.

WHY THE DOCUMENTS ARE DERIVED, NOT INVENTED
An anti-bribery critic and a contract-integrity method are only worth anything
if a clause can be checked against what was actually paid. A corpus of
free-standing dummy contracts would read convincingly and prove nothing: no
clause would tie to a contract_id, so no agent could ever find a transaction
that contradicts one.

So every document here is composed FROM a real `contracts` row. The price
clause quotes that row's agreed_unit_price for that row's part_number; the
rebate clause quotes the real tier thresholds out of its rebate_schedule JSON;
the term dates are its effective_from/effective_to; the bid reference is its
bid_id. Nothing in the text is chosen freely except the surrounding legal
prose, and that prose is deliberately generic.

The contradictions are therefore already in the data and were not planted:
8 of the 10 contracts carry transactions paid above their agreed price, and 69
of 164 transactions carry no contract_id at all. The documents simply state,
citably, the terms those payments breach.

WHAT THIS EMITS
  data/contracts/<contract_id>.txt   the document text
  contract_clauses                   one row per clause, with a recoverable_basis
  unstructured_docs_metadata         one row per document
  doc_chunks                         one row per clause (a clause is the chunk)

Chunking on the clause boundary is deliberate: the retrieval unit and the
citation unit are then the same thing, so an agent that cites a passage is
citing a clause id rather than an arbitrary window of characters.

Usage:
    python scripts/generate_contract_corpus.py --dry-run     # write files only
    python scripts/generate_contract_corpus.py --load        # also load BigQuery
