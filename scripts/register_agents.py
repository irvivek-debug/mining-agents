"""Register agents as Vertex AI Reasoning Engines and into Gemini Enterprise.

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN THE VAULT'S SCRIPT
`deployment/register_all_agents_to_agent_registry.py` in the vault is a 30-line
shim that dynamically loads a root script which is not in the bucket, so it
cannot run. The vault's other lead -- Mendel forced_flags -- is Google-internal
experiment plumbing, not a customer-runnable API. Neither is needed: the 90
agents already registered were created through the Discovery Engine `agents`
endpoint, and this reproduces that path.

TWO STEPS PER AGENT, AND THE SECOND DEPENDS ON THE FIRST
  1. ReasoningEngine.create() -- the A2A / Agent Registry entry
  2. an `agents` entry on the Gemini Enterprise assistant, whose
     adkAgentDefinition.provisionedReasoningEngine points at step 1

Both are idempotent: an agent already carrying a reasoning engine, or already
present on the assistant, is skipped rather than duplicated. Re-running after a
partial failure resumes instead of creating a second copy.

Usage:
    python scripts/register_agents.py --list
    python scripts/register_agents.py --agents S10-R-CRITIC,S11-COORDINATOR
    python scripts/register_agents.py --agents ... --confirm yes-register-for-real

#
# An Agent Engine in us-central1 resolves publisher models regionally, so it

    THE CONSTRAINT
    Whatever is passed here is cloudpickled into the deployed artefact. Passing
    the local ADC put a developer refresh token inside it -- measured, 1,107
    bytes with the token present -- which would place a human's Google
    credential into a Cloud resource.

    THE FIX
    compute_engine.Credentials() carries no refresh token, no client secret and
    no token value: 742 bytes of nothing but a resolution strategy. It fetches
    a token from the host metadata server at call time, which on Agent Engine
    is the engine's own service account. So the artefact is credential-free AND
    the agent reads exactly what its own identity is granted -- which is what
    makes per-tier IAM scoping real rather than decorative.

    A previous attempt deferred construction behind a BaseToolset subclass that
    nulled itself on pickle. The artefact was clean, but the engine never
    called get_tools() on it and the agent reported having no BigQuery tool at
    all. Credential safety was verified; tool delivery was not. Both are
    checked now.
