"""Generate one unfakeable grounding probe per agent, from the catalogue.

Hand-writing 100 probes invites two mistakes I already made once: typing an
expected value that is wrong (17 critical assets; it is 15), and asking
something a model can guess. Both are avoided by deriving the probe from the
agent's own declared table and letting SQL supply the answer at test time.

Each probe asks for a COUNT and a numeric AVG over a table the agent declares.
Neither is guessable -- a model has no prior on how many rows a private table
holds -- and both change if the data changes, so a memorised reply drifts out
of tolerance rather than passing forever.
