"""Open the deployed, private workspace in a local browser.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`scripts/deploy_apps.py` puts the workspace on Cloud Run behind an invoker
check, because the org policy `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`
refuses the `allUsers` binding that would make it public. An authenticated
Cloud Run service does not redirect a browser to a sign-in page — it answers
403 and stops — so the deployed URL cannot simply be opened or sent to
someone, even by a person who holds run.invoker on it.

What is missing is not permission. It is a way to put a Google-signed token on
a request that a browser will not attach by itself. This module is that: a
loopback HTTP server that accepts an ordinary browser request, adds the
Authorization header, forwards it to the real service, and returns the real
response. Everything the browser renders came from the deployed revision, not
from the checkout — which is the whole point, since a static file server on
this laptop would show the same pages while proving nothing about the deploy.

`gcloud run services proxy` does the same job. It is the better tool when it
works; it is not usable here because it authenticates with the gcloud CLI
credential, which on this machine needs an interactive reauth that a
non-interactive session cannot answer. Application Default Credentials, which
this module uses instead, are valid.

WHY IT MINTS THE TOKEN ITSELF
------------------------------
Cloud Run rejects an OAuth access token with 401. It requires an OIDC identity
token, and `gcloud auth print-identity-token` reads the same CLI credential
that is unusable here. So the token is minted directly from the ADC refresh
grant: Google's token endpoint returns an `id_token` alongside the access
token when the request carries the ADC client id and secret, and that is what
the invoker check accepts.

Tokens last an hour, which is shorter than a demo. The cache below re-mints
one when it has under five minutes left, so a session does not fail halfway
through with a 401 that looks like a broken deploy.
