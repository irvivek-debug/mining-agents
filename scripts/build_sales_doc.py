"""Build the sales companion document for the agent recordings.

One entry per agent: a context paragraph (~100 words) written so a reader
who has never seen the system understands the input (the operational
scenario), the output (what the agent concluded, with its real numbers),
and the logic (the governing method and the tables it read) — then the
video path and the live agent link.

Everything is drawn from recorded evidence: the scenario prompts, the
ledger's captured replies, and the catalogue. Nothing is invented.
