"""Functional gate: the deployed workspace can actually serve what it advertises.

Every check in the unit suite reads local files. None of them can see the
failure that actually reaches a viewer: the page ships a video filename, the
object was never uploaded under that name, and the browser gets a 404 on a
recording the sales script is describing out loud. That failure is invisible
locally -- `sales-assets.js` is correct, the file exists in `data/uat/videos/`,
and only the GCS object is missing. It is the expected state after every
re-record, because each new capture gets a new content hash.

Two stages, because they fail for different reasons:

  manifest -> GCS   every recording the served manifest names exists as an
                    object. This is the check that catches the 404.
  serving           the Flask app, run in-process against the real bucket,
                    returns the page, the manifest, and ranged video bytes.
                    This exercises the streaming code path, not just storage.

The app driven here -- apps/frontend/server/main.py -- is deployed as the Cloud
Run service `mining-agents-showcase`, NOT `mag-workspace`. The two are easy to
confuse: mag-workspace runs apps.workspace.server (FastAPI, no /videos route)
and is the service scripts/deploy_apps.py targets. Deploying mag-workspace does
nothing for the recordings. Redeploy this one with:

    gcloud run deploy mining-agents-showcase \
        --source apps/frontend/server --region us-central1 \
        --no-allow-unauthenticated

The deployed service sits behind IAP, so an end-to-end HTTPS check would need
either a service-account key or an interactive IAP sign-in. Neither belongs in
a script, so this deliberately stops at the bucket and the app, and says so.
Confirming the IAP sign-in itself is a human loading the page.

Usage:
    python scripts/smoke_workspace.py
