"""Drive each registered agent through the Gemini Enterprise UI and record it.

WHAT THIS TESTS THAT AN API CALL DOES NOT
Invoking an Agent Engine over REST proves the engine answers. It does not prove
the agent is reachable, selectable and usable in the product a person actually
opens. This drives the real UI -- navigating to each agent's own session URL,
typing into the real composer, waiting for the rendered reply -- so a pass means
a human could have done the same thing.

ASSERTIONS THAT CAN ACTUALLY FAIL
The vault's ledger certified 101 agents with asserted outputs like "Executes
domain physics calculations and provides grounded recommendations", which no
response could fail -- and it certified an estate where every engine was
404ing. So the checks here are the ones a wrong answer trips:

  answered        a reply arrived at all, and it is not an error surface
  in_character    it reaches for its own domain -- a term from its governing
                  equation, its department, or a table it declares
  no_fabrication  it does not claim an injection, compromise or breach without
                  evidence: the exact failure S07 shipped to a human on 20 Aug
