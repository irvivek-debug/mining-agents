"""Generate `purchase_orders` from parts and vendors that already exist.

WHY THIS TABLE IS GENERATED AND THE OTHER TWO ARE VIEWS
`vendor_contracts` and `spares_inventory` are views because `contracts` and
`inventory_levels` already hold what the S10 and S11 agents need under a
different name. `purchase_orders` has no equivalent anywhere in the dataset,
so it is the one table here that is genuinely new.

It is still not invented from nothing. Every row draws its part from
`inventory_levels` (and inherits that part's lead_time_days and
unit_price_usd), its vendor from `contracts`, and its contract_id from a
contract that actually covers that part — so a lead-time query, a price query
and a coverage query all reconcile against the tables they join to.

Delivery performance is the signal S11-2-LEADTIME exists to read, so it is
deliberately spread: most orders land inside the quoted lead time, a minority
run late, and a few are still open. The spread is produced by a seeded
generator, so re-running this reproduces the same table rather than quietly
changing every figure under the tests that pin them.

Usage:
    python scripts/generate_purchase_orders.py            # write JSONL only
    python scripts/generate_purchase_orders.py --load     # also load BigQuery
