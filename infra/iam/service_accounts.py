"""Three shared service accounts, one per least-privilege tier.

Every agent runs as one of exactly three accounts. This is a deliberate
departure from one-account-per-agent, ruled on 2026-08-12:

  1. Only 52 things actually deploy — 12 `Workflow` graphs and 40 `LlmAgent`s.
     A swarm's 4 sub-agents are nodes inside their coordinator's graph and
     share its process, so they can never hold a separate runtime identity.
     48 of the original 100 accounts could not have been attached to anything.
  2. This build is a functional showcase that is demonstrated repeatedly. The
     default quota is 100 service accounts per project; a 100-account build
     exhausts a fresh project on its first run and cannot be repeated.

WHAT THIS COSTS, accepted knowingly: an agent runs with its whole tier's
access rather than its own. There is no intra-tier isolation — a prompt
injection that reaches one agent's query tool reaches every table its tier
can read. Per-agent (or per-swarm) accounts are the documented hardening
path for a customer taking this to production.

WHAT THIS DISSOLVES: biometric table access can no longer be restricted by
IAM, because the agents that read biometric data and the agents that do not
now share an account. See `test_biometric_access_is_not_restricted_at_the_iam_layer`
— the control has to live in the application layer or it does not exist.

No service-account credential file is ever created, downloaded, or stored —
Workload Identity Federation supplies credentials at runtime. This file
contains no credential-management calls of any kind.
