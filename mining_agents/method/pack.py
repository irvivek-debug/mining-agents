"""Load and validate a persona's method pack.

The pack is the method's SKELETON: which drivers exist, in what order, which
are controllable, and what guards a recommendation. It deliberately carries no
resolution prose — resolution content comes from the document corpus, so that
a recommendation is the customer's own standard rather than ours.
