-- Task 10 — retrain the seven BQML models against the regenerated data.
--
-- ARCHITECTURE IS UNCHANGED. Every statement below is a byte-faithful
-- reproduction of the model's original CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL statement,
-- recovered from `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT (the models
-- were all created 2026-06-20). Same MODEL_TYPE, same OPTIONS, same feature
-- list, same joins, same filters. Only the underlying table contents differ,
-- because Task 8 replaced the ten source tables.
--
-- Model names: the plan and design docs call these "the four
-- `downtime_regression_model*` models". The deployed names are actually
-- `downtime_regression_model`, `inventory_impact_model_pump`,
-- `inventory_impact_model_mill`, `inventory_impact_model_crusher` — four
-- LINEAR_REG models whose label is `total_downtime_duration`. A fifth,
-- `inventory_impact_model`, is the one the plan names separately. Verified by
-- `bq ls --models`; do not trust the doc naming.
--
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- !! PREFLIGHT — RUN SECTION 0 FIRST. DO NOT RUN SECTION B WHILE IT REPORTS 0 !!
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- HISTORY. The first Task-10 attempt found the live
-- `maintenance_logs.parts_replaced` array EMPTY on all 152 rows, which left the
-- five Section B models with zero training rows (they reach `inventory_levels`
-- only through UNNEST(parts_replaced) -> part_number, and a BigQuery join that
-- matches nothing succeeds silently at zero rows). Root cause was a missing
-- `--parquet_enable_list_inference` on `bq load`: without it a 3-level parquet
-- LIST group is not mapped onto a BigQuery ARRAY.
--
-- That defect is FIXED. As of the Task-10b run the live table carries 186
-- element values across 126 of 152 rows and Section 0 reports non-zero for all
-- seven models, so Sections A and B have both been executed.
--
-- The preflight is kept, and Section B remains gated on it: it is cheap, and
-- the failure mode it guards (CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL destroying a deployed
-- model and replacing it with nothing) is not recoverable.
--
-- SECTION C adds ONE NEW MODEL, `telemetry_alarm_risk_model`. It is not one of
-- the seven and does not replace any of them. Architecture change was approved
-- for that model only; the seven above are a pure data refresh.
-- =============================================================================


-- =============================================================================
-- SECTION 0 — PREFLIGHT. Every count must be > 0 before the matching model in
-- Section A/B may be retrained. Zero means "do not run"; it does not mean
-- "the query is broken".

-- =============================================================================
-- SECTION C — NEW MODEL: `telemetry_alarm_risk_model`
--
-- This is the eighth model and the only one whose architecture is new. It is
-- additive: it replaces none of the seven above and none of them feed it.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS
-- -------------
-- The Task 10 brief's headline acceptance test is "ML.PREDICT on PUMP-104A
-- returns a materially worse outcome inside the degradation ramp than outside
-- it". None of the seven can satisfy that: not one of them reads
-- `telemetry_stream`, none has a time-varying feature, and their label is
-- repair-hours. The ramp has no path into their input vector. This model gives
-- the shared `bqml_predict` tool something that has actually seen telemetry.
--
-- FORMULATION — why a hazard probability, not a time-to-failure regression
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A time-to-failure (RUL) regression needs observed failure events to regress
-- against. This dataset contains exactly ONE degradation episode (PUMP-104A,
-- final 21 days) and no recorded failure. A TTF label would therefore be a
-- relabelling of "hours until the end of the table" fitted on a single episode,
-- which is not estimable and would not generalise.
--
-- What IS estimable from 13 series x 2004 samples is a discrete-time hazard:
--   P(this series breaches its alarm threshold at some point in the next 7 days)
-- Every series contributes both positives and negatives, and the quantity is
-- the one a maintenance planner actually acts on. Rising probability is the
-- "materially worse outcome" the brief asks for.
--
-- ALARM THRESHOLD
-- ---------------
-- Per (asset, metric): mu0 + 3*sd0, where mu0/sd0 are that series' own
-- commissioning baseline, computed over a FIXED reference period
-- 2026-01-01 .. 2026-03-01. The reference period is chosen to end well before
-- the ramp (2026-05-26 22:00) so that the ramp cannot inflate its own
-- threshold. A per-series 3-sigma band is the standard condition-monitoring
-- alarm; it is not tuned to any asset.
--
-- NO LABEL LEAKAGE — the six features are, deliberately:
--   z_now         current sample, in baseline sigma
--   z_mean_24h    trailing 24 h mean, in baseline sigma
--   z_mean_72h    trailing 72 h mean, in baseline sigma
--   z_trend_48h   trailing-24 h mean minus the preceding-24 h mean (slope)
--   z_vol_72h     trailing 72 h standard deviation, in baseline sigma
--   peer_z_24h    mean z_mean_24h of the SAME asset's OTHER metrics at time t
-- Every one is a backward-looking function of `telemetry_stream` alone, all
-- available at prediction time. There is deliberately NO asset_id, NO
-- metric_name, NO timestamp, NO ramp/window flag and NO failure flag among the
-- inputs. The model cannot key on "which asset" or "when"; it can only key on
-- what the sensors are doing. All window frames are RANGE-over-seconds rather
-- than ROWS so that the ~0.4 % telemetry dropouts do not shift a lookback.
-- The label window is strictly `1 FOLLOWING .. 604800 FOLLOWING` seconds, so no
-- future sample can reach a feature.
--
-- TRAINING WINDOW — the ramp is held out
-- --------------------------------------
-- Training rows are 2026-03-01 00:00 .. 2026-05-19 22:00. The upper bound is
-- ramp_start (2026-05-26 22:00) minus the 7-day label horizon, so neither a
-- feature nor a label of any training row can touch the ramp. The ramp is
-- therefore a genuine out-of-sample period: if the model separates ramp from
-- flat, it did so by generalising a degradation signature learned from ordinary
-- excursions on all five assets, not by memorising this episode.
-- Training set: 12,411 rows after NULL filtering, 630 positives (5.1 %).
