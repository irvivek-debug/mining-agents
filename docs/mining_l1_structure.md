# Agentic Mining Transformation: Level 1 Low Code PRD

This document specifies the requirements, use cases, and configuration parameters for Level 1 (Task and Sub-process Execution) Surface Knowledge Applications. These systems leverage conversational LLMs, hybrid structured and unstructured RAG, and BigQuery Data Store integrations across the mining life cycle.

The focus of this specification is on task-level automation and knowledge mapping aligned with the American Productivity and Quality Center (APQC) Process Classification Framework.
