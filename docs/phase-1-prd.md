# Phase 1 PRD — Mining Agent Suite (100 ADK Agents)

**Cloud:** `genial-union-475913-i7` · BigQuery `mining_data` (US)
**Build framework:** ADK throughout. Deploy to Agent Runtime, register in Agent Registry.
**Intent:** demo / sales showcase **and** reference solution accelerator.
**Counting convention:** Option 1 — ADK agent instances. 12 swarms × (1 coordinator + 4 specialists) = 60 Pattern A agents, plus 40 Pattern B deep agents = **100**.

> **GATE.** Approve this PRD before Phase 2 (UX). No implementation code is written until Phases 1–4 are all approved.

## 1. Problem statement

Realised value per ton of ore at the site is below plan. The gap is not one failure — it is six, and no single role can see across them. Evidence drawn from the live dataset, not assumed:

| Signal | Measured value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Work orders at CRITICAL priority | **101 of 500** | `erp_work_orders` |
| Work orders CANCELLED (deferred, will resurface) | **104 of 500**, $617k booked repair cost | `erp_work_orders` |
| Spare parts below reorder point | **15 of 105**, against 15.2-day mean lead time | `inventory_levels` |
| Concentrator recovery spread | **88.2% – 95.2%** (mean 92.2%) at `CONC-01` | `metallurgical_recovery` |
| Safety incidents on record | **60**, including fatality-class events | `safety_incidents` |
| Fatigue readings unreviewed per operator population | **3,340** across 20 operators | `biometric_fatigue_logs` |

Each of these is owned by a different person, sits in a different table, and is worked in a different tool. The cost is not any one number — it is that a predicted mill failure and an out-of-stock bearing are the same event, discovered six weeks apart.

## 2. Personas

Carried forward from Phase 0 unchanged.

| # | Persona | Owns | Core pain |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Reliability Engineer | `telemetry_stream`, `crusher_states`, `asset_dependencies`, `simulation_runs`, `MiningAssetGraph` | No automated link from a vibration excursion to the dependent asset it will take down. |
| P2 | Maintenance Planner | `erp_work_orders`, `maintenance_logs`, `work_order_parts_edge` | Cannot tell which of 104 cancellations were deferrals that will return worse. |
| P3 | Mine Safety & Health Manager | `safety_incidents`, `biometric_fatigue_logs`, `radio_communications`, `incident_involvements` | Fatigue and radio signals arrive faster than any human can triage; incidents are reconstructed after the fact. |
| P4 | Supply Chain / Procurement Manager | `inventory_levels`, `rfp_items`, `procurement_bids`, `MiningSupplyChainGraph` | 300 bids to evaluate with no link back to the work orders that need the parts. |
| P5 | Resource Geologist | `drill_holes`, `drill_assay_logs`, `geological_block_models` | 295 assay intervals vs 1,000 modelled blocks; reconciliation is manual and episodic. |
| P6 | Metallurgist / Concentrator Superintendent | `metallurgical_recovery`, `crusher_states` | No closed loop from crusher settings to recovery outcome. |
| P7 | Mine Ops / Dispatch Supervisor | `fleet_vehicles`, `haulage_routes`, `operator_vehicle_assignments` | Route congestion is recorded but not acted on within the shift. |
| P8 | Shift Superintendent | escalation target for P1–P7 | Assembles handover by hand from seven sources. |

## 3. Jobs to be done

| JTBD | Persona |
|---|---|
| When a critical asset shows degradation, tell me what else it takes down and whether I can survive to the next planned window. | P1 |
| When I plan a shutdown, tell me which work orders I can actually close given the parts I have. | P2 |
| When an operator is unfit, tell me before they get in the truck, and tell me who covers the shift. | P3 |
| When a part goes below reorder point, tell me which work orders and which assets are exposed, in dollars. | P4 |
| When the plant misses recovery, tell me whether geology delivered what the model promised. | P5, P6 |
| When cycle times inflate mid-shift, give me a re-plan I can commit before the shift ends. | P7 |
| At handover, give me one brief that is complete and admits what it does not know. | P8 |

## 4. Success metrics

Two classes, because this asset is judged twice — once in a demo room, once by an engineer forking it.

**Business metrics the demo claims** (baseline → target, baselines measured above):

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Recovery rate variance at `CONC-01` | 7.0 pt spread (88.2–95.2) | ≤ 4.0 pt spread |
| Parts below reorder point | 15 of 105 (14.3%) | ≤ 5 of 105 (4.8%) |
| CRITICAL work orders open at any time | 21 OPEN of 101 CRITICAL | ≤ 10 OPEN |
| Fatigue events reaching an operator before shift start | 0% (post-hoc only) | 100% of `fatigue_alert_triggered` |
| Mean time from telemetry anomaly to dependency-impact assessment | manual, hours | < 60 seconds |

**Accelerator metrics** — what makes it reusable rather than a one-off:

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Agents whose grounding resolves to a real table/column | 100 of 100 |
| Agents reachable from a persona JTBD in §3 | 100 of 100 |
| Swarms demonstrating genuine A2A delegation + peer critique | 12 of 12 |
| Agents with a hardcoded model ID | 0 |
| Agents requiring data that does not exist in `mining_data` | 0 |

## 5. Agent inventory

### 5.1 Pattern A — Multi-Agent Swarms (12 swarms · 60 agents)

Every swarm carries a **Critic** as its fourth specialist. That is not padding: peer critique is the mechanism that makes a swarm defensible rather than a fan-out, and it is what a technical buyer will look for.

### 5.3 Agents by persona

| Persona | Pattern B | Pattern A (swarms led) | Total agents |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 Reliability Engineer | 6 (D01–D06) | S01, S03 → 10 | **16** |
| P2 Maintenance Planner | 4 (D07–D10) | S02 → 5 | **9** |
| P3 Safety & Health Manager | 6 (D35–D40) | S05, S10, S11 → 15 | **21** |
| P4 Supply Chain / Procurement | 8 (D27–D34) | S08, S09 → 10 | **18** |
| P5 Resource Geologist | 5 (D16–D20) | S06 → 5 | **10** |
| P6 Metallurgist | 6 (D21–D26) | S07 → 5 | **11** |
| P7 Dispatch Supervisor | 5 (D11–D15) | S04 → 5 | **10** |
| P8 Shift Superintendent | 0 | S12 → 5 | **5** |
| | **40** | **60** | **100** |

Safety (P3) carries the largest share at 21. That is deliberate and defensible: it is the only branch in the dataset with fatality-class outcomes, and it holds the richest graph (3,350 edges).

### 5.4 Agents by process (APQC)

| APQC | Process | Branch | Pattern B | Pattern A | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **11.0.3** | Maintain production equipment | B1 | 10 | S01, S02, S03 → 15 | **25** |
| **4.3.1** | Manage logistics & dispatch | B2 | 5 | S04, S05, S12 → 15 | **20** |
| **9.1.2** | Manage environment, health & safety | B6 | 6 | S10, S11 → 10 | **16** |
| **4.2.2** | Manage production / processing | B4 | 6 | S07 → 5 | **11** |
| **2.0.1** | Manage exploration & resource definition | B3 | 5 | S06 → 5 | **10** |
| **4.1.2** | Manage materials & inventory | B5 | 5 | S08 → 5 | **10** |
| **5.2.1** | Manage procurement & sourcing | B5 | 3 | S09 → 5 | **8** |
| | | | **40** | **60** | **100** |

Swarms spanning two processes are counted once, under the process of the coordinator's owning department, to keep the total at exactly 100.

### 5.5 HITL summary

**14 agents carry `hitl_required: true`** — 9 swarm coordinators (S01, S02, S04, S05, S07, S08, S09, S10, S11) and 5 deep agents (D07, D14, D25, D30, D37). Every one of them either writes to a system of record, changes a physical setpoint, commits spend, or removes a person from duty. All 14 require Hold-to-Confirm plus an audit trail in Phase 2 UX. The remaining 86 are read-only analysis and need no confirmation gate.

> **Corrected 2026-08-12.** This paragraph read "20 agents — 9 swarm coordinators and 11 deep agents". The 9 was right; the 11 was not. The per-agent tables in §5.1 and §5.2 above — which are what the build was written from — mark exactly 5 deep agents `true` and 35 `false`, and have done since the first draft. The prose was the only place the number 20 appeared. Counting the tables is authoritative; `tests/catalog/test_definitions.py::test_exactly_fourteen_agents_are_hitl` pins the result so the two cannot drift apart again.

## 6. Citation Mandate

**Not applicable.** The Citation Mandate is required only when the inventory contains at least one Pattern C agent. This inventory contains **zero Pattern C agents** by explicit scope decision — Pattern C assets already exist and were excluded.

Grounding discipline is not abandoned, only relocated: `MiningOntologyGraph` and `unstructured_docs_metadata` are exposed as **ADK tools** consumed by Pattern A and B agents, and every agent's output must name the tables it read. That requirement is specified as a tool contract in Phase 3, not as a Citation Mandate string.

## 7. Assumptions and open questions

Carried forward verbatim from Phase 0, plus two that arose while building the inventory.

* **ASSUMPTION**: The five `assets` rows represent asset *classes* to be shown at demo scale, not the site's true asset register. — If wrong, per-asset agents collapse to five instances and the swarm topology should be re-cut by process area instead of by asset.
* **ASSUMPTION**: Telemetry covers all five `assets` rows — `CONVEYOR-02`, `CRUSHER-03`, `MILL-01`, `PUMP-104A`, `TRUCK-08` (two-hourly, 2026-01-01 → 2026-06-16) — at a deliberate demo sampling rate rather than a production historian rate. — If wrong, the two-hourly interval is too coarse for D01–D04 and S01 to resolve a fast-developing fault and the series must be regenerated at a finer cadence. Coverage for `CONVEYOR-02` and `TRUCK-08` was added by data injections A2/A3; before that only three assets were instrumented, which is what the earlier revision of this assumption recorded.
* **ASSUMPTION**: `safety_incidents.root_cause` is pre-populated because the data is synthetic; in a real deployment root cause is the *output* of investigation, not an input. — If wrong, S11 and D39 are reading their own answer key. **Mitigated in design**: S11's fourth specialist is a *Root-Cause Challenge Critic* that must corroborate the stated cause against `radio_communications` and `incident_involvements` independently, and report disagreement. Do not demo S11 as deriving root cause from scratch.
* **ASSUMPTION**: No tailings/piezometer, LOTO permit, or EPC contractor schedule data exists. — Confirmed absent. The three corresponding playbook agents are dropped rather than built on invented data.
* **OPEN QUESTION**: `metallurgical_recovery` has a single concentrator (`CONC-01`). D21–D24 therefore compare against time, not against peer units. If a second concentrator is expected, say so now — it changes those four agents from trend analysis to benchmarking.
* **OPEN QUESTION**: Should swarm specialists be individually registered in Agent Registry, or only the 12 coordinators? The metrics above assume **coordinators only** (52 registry entries: 12 + 40). Registering all 100 is possible but makes the registry harder to navigate for a buyer.

## 8. Out of scope

- **Pattern C / GE App low-code agents** — excluded by explicit instruction; existing assets cover this.
- **New data generation.** The build grounds in the 28 tables that exist. No table is created to make an agent possible; agents that would need one were dropped (see §7).
- **Production hardening** — SLOs, multi-region, DR, quota management, cost controls. This is a showcase and accelerator, not a production pilot.
- **Repo remediation of `agent_manifest.json`** — the existing 4-agent petroleum-flavoured manifest and the 6 non-existent table references in `docs/` are superseded by this PRD. Cleanup is tracked separately.
- **Real-time streaming ingestion.** All agents read BigQuery at rest.
- **UX screens, data model, and access model** — Phases 2 and 3.
