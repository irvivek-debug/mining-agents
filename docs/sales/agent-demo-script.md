# Agent demo script

**98 agents, every prompt verified live.** Each was run through Gemini Enterprise in a signed-in browser and its answer recorded. The prompts below are the ones that produced the answers shown.


Expect roughly **23.9s** to first response. Ask the follow-up — it is where the governance story lands.


## How to run a demo

1. Open the agent's own link (each section has one).
2. Paste **Turn 1** verbatim. Wait ~25s.
3. While it answers, say the *Set up* line.
4. Paste **Turn 2**. This is the moment that matters: the agent states what it cannot do on its own authority.
5. If asked "is this real?" — the *Grounded in* tables are live BigQuery.


## Pick by audience
