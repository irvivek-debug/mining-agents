 * It is untrusted. The answer is going into innerHTML, so it is escaped before
 * a single markdown rule is applied. The other order — render, then escape —
 * is the one defect worth naming: it turns a <script> the model emitted into
 * an element, and it also double-escapes the tags the renderer just made, so
 * it fails loudly in one direction and silently in the other.
 *
 * And it is not ours to edit. A live run of S01 opened its answer with "The
 * call to `default_api:graph_traverse` failed", listed an INVALID_ARGUMENT and
 * a required `asset_id`, and put all of it in the largest body text on the role
 * page. Three specialists, a critic and a coordinator write into one stream, so
 * that arrives butted against the next agent's first sentence with no break.
 *
 * The rules below are narrow on purpose. Nothing here invents a phrase: a
 * failed call is said with failLine(), the same sentence the activity log
 * prints, and a table is said with TABLES. Where no mapping exists — a column
 * name, a part number, an agent id — the term is left alone rather than

 * to the *opening* one of `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and splits a bullet in half.
 * Scanning left to right pairs the backticks the way the model wrote them.

 * The heading rule excludes a preceding '#' for the same class of reason: a
 * '###' contains a '##', so a rule that only asks what comes before the hash
 * breaks every heading into two empty paragraphs and a heading. */
