/* Screen 2 — the gap, in this site's own record.
 *
 * The screen before this one makes a claim: the good day is already reachable,
 * because it already happened. This screen is where that claim has to survive
 * contact with the data, so it is built around one drawing repeated four times
 * rather than around a table of conclusions.
 *
 * The drawing sorts the days. That throws away the calendar deliberately — a
 * time series of the same numbers shows weather, and invites an argument about
 * which week was unusual. Sorted, the median day sits at the halfway mark and
 * the p90 day at the nine-tenths mark by construction, so the two figures the
 * whole business case rests on can be pointed at instead of asserted.
