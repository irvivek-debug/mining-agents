/* Screen 1.3 — what the gap is worth.
 *
 * The order of this screen is the argument, and it was deliberately inverted
 * from an earlier draft that opened with a 52-cell partition. A partition is a
 * proof of tidiness; it answers a question nobody has asked yet. So the price
 * of a recovery point goes first, the six pools that release it go second, and
 * the proof that the six do not overlap goes third — available to a reader who
 * wants it, out of the way of one who has already been convinced.
 *
 * The screen's discipline is that it never states a magnitude it cannot source.
 * One dollar figure in this repository is real. The calculator holds that line
 * by splitting itself in two: what this site's own record settles on the left,
 * what only the client holds on the right, and no arithmetic until the client
 * has typed. A CEO who is shown a number they did not supply stops trusting the
 * screen, and they are right to.
