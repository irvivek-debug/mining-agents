/* Screen 1.5 — following the connections.

 * is not retyped here — it is exported out of graph_traverse.py by the build —
 * and the walks below are written against the same edge labels and the same
 * direction of travel, one function per MATCH clause. Where the exported
 * subgraph is smaller than the warehouse table, the scope line says so rather
 * than the screen quietly implying it walked everything.
 *
 * What the reader sees is the walk in words: a starting point, a step, a count
 * of what the step reached. The query text, the graph names, the traversal ids
 * and the raw tool call are all still here, in the drawer at the foot, because
 * the argument this screen makes is that they agree with each other — and that
 * is not checkable if one half of the pair is missing.
