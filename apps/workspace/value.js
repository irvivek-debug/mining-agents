/* Screen: the value case, rebuilt as four bands for a sales/consulting
 * audience rather than an internal reader (design brief, 2026-08-18).
 *
 * 1. THE ARGUMENT      -- five moves, CEO slide 3: the economics inverted,
 *    the standard playbook is exhausted, the remaining cost is judgement not
 *    muscle, agents are the first technology that reaches it, the window is
 *    short.
 * 2. THE LEVERS        -- CEO slide 6: six traditional levers and what
 *    headroom is left in each, closing on the hinge of the whole argument.
 * 3. WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS -- the benchmark set as range bars, every
 *    figure attributed on its face, plus this build's own addressable-pool
 *    model kept visually distinct from the published ranges.
 * 4. WHY MOST PROGRAMMES MISS IT -- the industry's own failure rate, and what
 *    this build does differently: coverage declared, evidence classed, every
 *    number traced. The honesty machinery is the differentiator here, not a
 *    caveat bolted on at the end.
 *
 * Every percentage that did not come out of this build's own planning model
 * carries a named publisher beside it, never presented as something measured
 * on this site. That split -- INDUSTRY RANGE vs THIS BUILD'S MODEL -- is the
 * one visual distinction the whole page is built to protect (global
 * constraint: a reader must always be able to tell which is which).
 *
 * No dollar sign appears anywhere on this page, including inside the one
 * external figure (2.6 to 4.4 trillion) that is itself a currency amount: it
 * is spelled "trillion US dollars" instead. The rule that no currency mark
 * reaches a screen that has not declared itself a money screen is repo-wide
 * (tests/test_screen_copy.py), and this page is not on that declared list.
 *
 * Deliberately absent, carried over from the previous draft of this page: the
 * five-leak taxonomy and the three-class evidence ladder as dedicated bands.
 * Neither is this page's argument -- the taxonomy still renders on every
 * agent card (apps/workspace/agent-card.js), and the evidence-class idea
 * survives here as one line of band 4 rather than a section of its own.

 * Mining & Metals 2026, ABS, McKinsey. Steps 3 and 4 carry no percentage and
 * so carry no citation; they are this build's own framing of the argument,
 * not a claim borrowed from a publisher. */
