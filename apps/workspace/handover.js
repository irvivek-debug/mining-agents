/* The shift handover brief. One agent team, two buttons, and a document.
 *
 * Every other screen in this application is a place to ask something. This one
 * is a thing to read: the Shift Supervisor reads it at the change of shift,
 * decides what to carry forward, and often walks away with it on paper. So
 * there is no rail and no parameter — nothing that changes what the sheet is
 * about — and the whole document is written to survive being printed. The two
 * controls it does carry are the two things the reader does with it: write it,
 * and print it.
 *
 * The brief has four parts because four agents write it. Three each own a
 * subject — availability, production, safety — and the fourth reads what they
 * produced and names what they did not cover. That band renders on every load,
 * including when it has nothing to report, and the reason is in the
 * supervisor's own words further down the page: a brief that was useless
 * because it missed the crusher event is indistinguishable, to its reader, from
 * a brief that had nothing to miss. A band that appears only when there is
 * something to say cannot be trusted to be silent for the right reason.
 *
 * The agent ids, the process code, the model tiers and the real table names are
 * all in the technical detail at the foot. They are what an auditor checks the
 * sheet against; they are not what the supervisor reads at 6am.
