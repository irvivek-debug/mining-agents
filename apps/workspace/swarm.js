/* The agent teams. One shape, twelve of them.
 *
 * The reading this screen has to get right is the shape of a team. Four agents
 * run under a lead, but they are not four peers: the specialists work the
 * question at the same time and the reviewer works on what they produced.
 * Drawing the reviewer beside the specialists — which is what a flat roster
 * does — says it is one more opinion, when what it actually is is the stage
 * that challenges the other three. So the stages are rows, only the specialist
 * row fans sideways, and the reviewer sits below what it reads.
 *
 * The configuration is entirely catalog-driven: swap ?s= and the same code
 * renders a different team, because there is no per-team content here to go
 * stale.
