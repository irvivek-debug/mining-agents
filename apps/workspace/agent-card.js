/* One agent's business-framing card: the decision it owns, the leak(s) it
 * closes, its archetype and authority, what it moves on the metrics a
 * mining client already tracks, the financial line(s) it can move and at
 * what evidence class, how much of its method pack is actually
 * instrumented, and its own rigour statement.
 *
 * Shared between the persona page (one card per agent that carries one,
 * rendered beneath the role's governing question) and the value page (AGT-19's
 * card, which has no persona to render it on). One renderer, so the two
 * screens cannot draw the same field two different ways -- see design doc
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-17-value-framing-and-agent-cards-design.md
 * section 2.
 *
 * AUTHORITY IS DECLARED, NOT ENFORCED. See AgentCard's own docstring in
 * mining_agents/catalog/definitions.py. Every card says so in words next to
 * the authority line, not as a footnote a reader can miss: the failure mode
 * this guards against is a reader assuming the platform stops an agent at its
 * stated level, and it does not -- there is no authority engine in this build.
 * The caveat is framed as the governance strength it actually is -- advisory
 * by default, every recommendation lands with a named human -- rather than as
 * an apology, while still saying plainly that nothing here enforces it (plan
 * 2026-08-18, "re-cut authority positively" -- both halves have to survive in
 * the same line, or the positive framing becomes an overclaim).
 *
 * COVERAGE MUST READ AS WHAT IT IS. A card at 0 of N drivers instrumented
 * renders the same row, in the same place, as a card at 5 of 7 -- never
 * blank, never styled as a fault. That is the distinction
 * mining_agents/tools/run_diagnostic.py already draws for a single
 * not_instrumented driver ("a SUCCESSFUL call, not a failure"); this is the
 * same distinction at the level of a whole pack, said the positive way round
 * ("N diagnostics proven, M scoped") rather than the fraction-of-a-target way
 * round ("N of N+M instrumented") -- the two counts still add back to the
 * total, so a card at 2 of 5 stays readable as 2 of 5 by anyone who adds them.
 *
 * METRIC IMPACT IS A BENCHMARK, NEVER A MEASUREMENT. `card.metric_impacts` is
 * a list of published, sourced ranges (mining_agents/catalog/definitions.py,
 * MetricImpact) -- an industry firm's claim about what agents like this one
 * move, never a number this build measured on the client's own data. Every
 * range renders with its source on its own face (the INDUSTRY RANGE badge
 * plus the firm's name), because an unattributed percentage on a card headed
 * for a mining client is the line that ends the conversation. A card whose
 * `metric_impacts` is empty (S03, S05 today) is not missing anything -- the
 * plan is explicit that this is a deliberate honesty decision, not a gap --
 * and it renders that as a stated fact beside the badge that never lies for
 * it, in the same "declared, not silently dropped" register the coverage row
 * already uses.
