/* Shared pieces of Application 2.
 *
 * The workspace is where a person does the work, so every screen has to answer
 * three questions the case application never had to: what does this agent
 * actually read, by what method, and what part of the answer is not settled.
 * The components below are the four answers, written once:
 *
 *   runState()   — whether the deployed agents are reachable at all
 *   agentCard()  — one entrypoint, at the level of detail a rail needs
 *   drawerMethod() — the formula, pattern or model behind a result
 *   inputs()     — the tables and columns, named, with their gaps
 *
 * The "drawer" prefix is not decoration. It says the function writes technical
 * drawer copy and nothing else, which is what lets tests/test_screen_copy.py
 * read it as drawer copy: a screen builds its drawer in drawerBody(), and a
 * builder shared across screens announces itself the same way. Without that,
 * a shared builder is scanned as body copy on every screen that loads it, and
 * an expression like "GRAPH TRAVERSAL · blast_radius" is either a false alarm
 * or an untestable exemption.
 *
 * Nothing here composes prose on an agent's behalf. Where an agent's own words
 * would go, notConnected() goes instead.
