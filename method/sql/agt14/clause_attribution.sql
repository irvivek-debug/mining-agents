-- One row per contract clause that a settled transaction actually breaches.
--
-- Scope is deliberately narrow and is stated rather than implied: the only
-- breach `contract_transactions` can evidence is a unit price paid above the
-- one the contract agreed, so this attributes overpayments to the clause that
-- fixes the price (clause_type = 'PRICE') and to no other clause. A rebate
-- that was never claimed, a duplicate payment and a late delivery each breach
-- a different clause, and each is measured by its own driver against its own
-- table; inventing rows for them here would attribute a number to a clause
-- this query never tested.
--
-- recoverable_usd sums only the positive gap, for the same reason
-- price_variance does: a transaction settled below the agreed price
-- contributes zero rather than a negative offset, so an underpayment on one
-- line cannot quietly cancel an overpayment on another within one contract.
--
-- clause_id and source_uri travel with every row so a finding cites the clause
-- and the document it is written in, which is the whole point of the driver —
-- a bare price mismatch names no obligation, and an obligation nobody can read
-- is not evidence.
