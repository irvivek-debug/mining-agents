-- Per asset-day, whether any telemetry metric on that asset exceeded @sigma
-- standard deviations from its series mean (excursion band vs normal band),
-- against the work order rate in the following @window_days.
-- Returns one row per band so that the separation between bands is legible.
-- A flat result — equal rates across bands — is a finding about this dataset
-- and must be reported as such. The query does not distinguish which metric
-- caused an excursion; the excursion_rate diagnostic carries that detail.
