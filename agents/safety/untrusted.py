"""Delimited, labelled untrusted context for free text read out of the dataset.

A technician typing "ignore previous instructions" into a notes field is a
plausible attack. This wrapper is control #1 of the five in design §6.2.

Applied in agents.tools.bq_query.run_query, keyed on the tables the BigQuery
dry run says the query ACTUALLY resolved to rather than on what the agent
declared — a query that declares four tables and reads one should not have the
other three's columns wrapped by name.

Like the biometric mask it sits beside, this matches on column name, so
`SELECT technician_notes AS n` escapes it. The prompt instruction in
agents/patterns/deep.py tells agents free text arrives wrapped; that is true
for any query that returns the column under its own name.
