"""Biometric masking. Enforced by code, not by prompt instruction.

Agents may say "OP-014 is HIGH fatigue risk". Agents may not emit a raw
heart rate, sleep deficit, or microsleep count.

Two controls, because neither one is sufficient alone:

  mask_rows          on the way IN — redacts the three raw columns in every
                     BigQuery result before the rows reach a model. Exact on
                     column names, but blind to `SELECT heart_rate_bpm AS hr`,
                     which returns a column named `hr`.
  scrub / redact_model_response
                     on the way OUT — redacts raw values in the text a model
                     produces, whatever it chose to call them. Catches the
                     aliased case above, and anything the model restates from
                     memory, but it is pattern matching: a value spelled out
                     in words ("a pulse of one-eighteen") survives.

Neither is an access control. What stops an agent reading a biometric table
it has no business in is `assert_reads_only_declared_tables` in
agents/tools/bq_query.py. These two limit what leaks from a table the agent
IS allowed to read — the 14 agents that legitimately analyse fatigue and are
required to report it as a band.

NOT enforceable at the IAM layer: all 100 agents share three service accounts,
so no binding can separate a biometric reader from a non-reader. See
infra/iam/service_accounts.py and its test_biometric_access_is_not_restricted_
at_the_iam_layer.
