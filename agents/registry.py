"""Registry payloads for the 52 externally-callable agents.

Swarm specialists and critics are sub-agents reachable only through their
coordinator. Registering them would falsely advertise 48 independently callable
agents as top-level Gateway endpoints — 12 swarms x (3 specialists + 1 critic).

Ruling R1: GATEWAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT is the identity the Agent Gateway uses when
it forwards a request to a top-level agent. This account is provisioned outside
the three tier accounts and is NOT created by infra.iam.service_accounts.apply().
It must not appear in {sa_email(a) for a in ALL_AGENTS} — a test enforces this.

# THE LOCAL PART OF THIS ADDRESS IS A PLACEHOLDER, NOT A CONFIRMED NAME.
# `gcloud iam service-accounts list` on this project returns no `agent-gateway`
# account, and the Agent Gateway team has not confirmed what theirs is called.
# It is written as a named constant precisely so that the guess lives in one
# place: every caller_allowlist entry for a top-level agent resolves through
# here, so confirming the real name is a one-line change plus a test run.
#
# Until it is confirmed, treat a Gateway call rejected by the allowlist as a
# likely symptom of this constant rather than of the allowlist logic.
#
# The test suite pins the one property that holds regardless of the name: this
# account must never collide with an agent's own tier account, or the Gateway
# would be indistinguishable from the agents it invokes.
